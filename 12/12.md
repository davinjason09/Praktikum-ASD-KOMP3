# Solution for 12

## Data Structure

- Disjoint Set Union (DSU) if you're implementing Kruskal's algorithm.
- Priority Queue (Min-Heap) if you're implementing Prim's algorithm.

In this case, we will use Kruskal. If you're using Prim's algorithm, the implementation is pretty trivial.

## Breakdown

- This type of problem is a pretty trivial Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, where we're tasked to find the minimum cost to connect all the offices.
- The solution is straight up just to implement either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
- The difference is that we need to do MST twice, once for the original network and one for the updated network after new connection is added.
- The input is a list of edges, where each edge has a cost and connects two offices.
- The output is the minimum cost to connect all offices.
- The other output is the list of edges that are included in the MST, however this is **OPTIONAL** for you to implement. You will get additional 10 points if you do.

## Implementation

#### Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Implementation

We will implement the DSU using path compression and union by rank. This implementation however, is slightly different than what were taught during the class.

The difference is on the `unite` function, where we reduce the amount of comparison made. This implementation is commonly used in competitive programming, while the difference is not that significant, it helps with branch prediction.

```cpp
struct DSU {
  vector<int> parent, rank;

  DSU(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
  }

  int find(int u) {
    return parent[u] == u ? u : parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
  }

  void unite(int u, int v) {
    u = find(u);
    v = find(v);
    if (u != v) {
      // If the rank of u is less than the rank of v, we swap them.
      if (rank[u] < rank[v]) swap(u, v);
      // This way, we always attach the smaller rank tree under
      // the larger rank tree without needing an additional comparison.
      parent[v] = u;
      // If the ranks are equal, we increment the rank of u as u became
      // the parent of v.
      if (rank[u] == rank[v]) rank[u]++;
    }
  }
};
```

#### Kruskal's Algorithm Implementation

The implementation is pretty trivial.

```cpp
int Kruskal(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<pii>& mst_edges) {
  sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a[2] < b[2];
  });

  DSU dsu(n);
  int totalWeight = 0;
  int edgeCount = 0;

  for (const auto& e : edges) {
    int u = e[0];
    int v = e[1];
    int w = e[2];

    if (dsu.find(u) != dsu.find(v)) {
      dsu.unite(u, v);
      mst_edges.emplace_back(u, v);
      totalWeight += w;
      edgeCount++;

      if (edgeCount == n - 1) break;
    }
  }

  return totalWeight;
}
```

#### Updating the Network

To update the network after adding a new connection, we can simply add the new edge to the list of edges and run Kruskal's algorithm again. The cost of the new connection will be added to the total cost.

```cpp
int main() {
  ... int k;
  cin >> k;
  for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
    cin >> u >> v >> w;
    edges.push_back({u, v, w});
  }

  mst_edges.clear();
  totalWeight = Kruskal(n, edges, mst_edges);

  cout << "Total biaya akhir: " << totalWeight << '\n';
  cout << "Koneski yang dipasang:\n";
  for (const auto& [u, v] : mst_edges) cout << u << ' ' << v << '\n';
}
```
