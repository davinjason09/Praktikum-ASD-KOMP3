# Solution for 5

## Data Structure / Algorithm

- Stack to check for balanced parentheses.
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring search.

## Breakdown

- In Lisp, parentheses are used to denote function calls and expressions. In order to evaluate Lisp expressions, we need to ensure that the parentheses are balanced.
- Petya also wants to find a substring in the given expression that matches a specific pattern.

## Implementation

#### Balanced Parentheses Check

We will use a Stack to check if the parentheses in the expression are balanced. As out input is in the form of a vector of strings, we will iterate through each string and check for the combined balance of parentheses, not per string.

But first, we will implement the Stack, which will be used to check for balanced parentheses.

We will define these interface for the Stack:

- `push`
- `pop`
- `peek`
- `isEmpty`

```cpp
struct Node {
  char op;
  Node* next;

  Node(char op) : op(op), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Stack {
private:
  Node* top;

public:
  Stack() : top(nullptr) {}

  void push(char op);
  char pop();
  char peek() const;
  bool isEmpty() const;
};

void Stack::push(char op) {
  Node* newNode = new Node(op);
  newNode->next = top;
  top = newNode;
}

char Stack::pop() {
  if (isEmpty()) throw runtime_error("Stack is empty");

  Node* temp = top;
  char op = top->op;
  top = top->next;
  delete temp;
  return op;
}

char Stack::peek() const {
  if (isEmpty()) throw runtime_error("Stack is empty");
  return top->op;
}

bool Stack::isEmpty() const {
  return top == NULL;
}
```

To check for balanced parentheses, we will iterate through the vector of strings and push each opening parenthesis onto the stack. For each closing parenthesis, we will pop from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening parenthesis.

```cpp
bool isValid(const vector<string>& code) {
  Stack stack;
  for (const string& line : code) {
    for (char ch : line) {
      if (ch == '(') stack.push(ch);
      else if (ch == ')' && (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '(')) return false;
      else continue;
    }
  }

  return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

#### KMP Algorithm for Substring Search

The Implementation is quite straightforward, basically the same as the one on the module for the most part. The difference however, the index found is the $Y$ value and the line number is the $X$ value.

```cpp
void computeLPS(const string& pat, vector<int>& lps) {
  int len = lps[0] = 0;
  int i = 1;
  int nPat = pat.length();

  while (i < nPat) {
    if (pat[i] == pat[len]) lps[i++] = ++len;
    else if (len != 0) len = lps[len - 1];
    else lps[i++] = 0;
  }
}

vector<int> KMPSearch(const string& text, const string& pattern) {
  int m = pattern.length();
  int n = text.length();
  vector<int> res;
  vector<int> lps(m);
  computeLPS(pattern, lps);

  int i = 0, j = 0;
  while (i < n) {
    if (pattern[j] == text[i]) i++, j++;

    if (j == m) res.push_back(i - j), j = lps[j - 1];
    else if (i < n && pattern[j] != text[i]) {
      if (j != 0) j = lps[j - 1];
      else i++;
    }
  }

  return res;
}

int main() {
  ...

  string pattern;
  cin >> pattern;

  bool found = false;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    vector<int> pos = KMPSearch(code[i], pattern);
    if (!pos.empty()) {
      found = true;
      for (int p : pos) cout << "Substring ditemukan pada [" << i + 1 << ", " << p + 1 << "]\n";
    }
  }

  if (!found) cout << "Substring tidak ditemukan\n";
}
```

## Fun Fact

#### Using `std::string` as a Stack

You can check the balance of parentheses only by using `std::string`. String is essentially a dynamic array of characters and inherit most of the interface of `std::vector`. You only need these methods:

- `push_back` to add a character to the end of the string. (This is equivalent to `push` in a stack.)
- `pop_back` to remove the last character from the string. (This is equivalent to `pop` in a stack.)
- `back` to get the last character of the string. (This is equivalent to `peek` in a stack.)

```cpp
bool isValid(const vector<string>& code) {
  string stack;
  for (const string& line : code) {
    for (char ch : line) {
      if (ch == '(') stack.push_back(ch);
      else if (ch == ')') {
        if (stack.empty() || stack.back() != '(') return false;
        stack.pop_back();
      }
    }
  }

  return stack.empty();
}
```

#### How this question is created

I was actually out of ideas, lol. There is a requirement that each question must include at least 2 algorithms / data structures. However, it is quite hard to come up with a question that fulfill those requirements, while making sure it's not too difficult.

Then I remembered that you already know how to check for balanced parentheses using stack, and substring search is pretty trivial with KMP. So I thought, why not combine them into one question? And here we are.

Why Lisp you ask? There aren't a lot of programming language that can be easily parsed by just using a stack, because most programming languages have more complex syntax. So initially I want to go with either HTML or XML, but I was worried because both language have different closing tag sequence, and I don't know the students know how to use `substr` from the string STL.

But then Lisp came to mind when I randomly scroll through people's GitHub repositories, looking for dotfiles, where I stumbled upon a Emacs Lisp configuration. I thought, why not? :p
